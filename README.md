# Diaspora

This is an unofficial webview based client for the social network "Diaspora". It's currently under development and should be used with that in mind. Please submit any bugs you might find.

### License
It's released under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (see LICENCE).

### Native
It's "native" because it's developed in Java + the Android SDK (Android Studio). Other Diaspora clients are developed using frameworks like AppCelerator Titanium. A native app will always be more efficient and almost certainly be faster and make better use of the resources of the device.

### "WebApp"
It's a WebApp because at this moment Diaspora doesn't have an API that can be used to create a native interface to retrieve the user's data, publications, direct messages and so on, that's why there are only WebApps for Diaspora out there.
Why a WebApp is better than using the mobile site on a browser? Basically it provides better integration with the system (events coming into and going out of the app), notifications, customized interface and functions and a nice little icon that takes you directly to your favorite social network :)

### System Requirements
The minimum version supported is Ice Cream Sandwitch, Android version 4.0.3 (or API 15)

### Permissions
It requires access to the Internet and to external storage to be able to upload photos when creating a new post and for taking screenshots.
