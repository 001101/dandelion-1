### License
It's released under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (see [LICENCE](https://github.com/Diaspora-for-Android/diaspora-android/blob/master/LICENSE.md)).

### WebApp
The app is developed as an WebApp because currently Diaspora doesn't have an API that can be used to create a native interface to retrieve the user's data, publications, direct messages and so on, that's why there are only WebApps for Diaspora out there.  
API is discussed frequently on Diaspora, but the main developers seem to not give the API and mobile view the attention it needs. [Stay tuned on Diaspora* Issues](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/labels/api).

Why a WebApp is better than using the mobile site on a browser?  
Basically it provides better integration with the system (events coming into and going out of the app), notifications, customized interface and functions and a nice little icon that takes you directly to your favorite social network :)

### Device Requirements
The minimum version supported is Ice Cream Sandwich, Android v4.0.3 / API 15

### App Permissions
It requires access to the Internet and to external storage to be able to upload photos when creating a new post and for taking screenshots.
